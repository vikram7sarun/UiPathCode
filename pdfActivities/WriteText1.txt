Beginning in 1946, the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) began
experimenting with rocket planes such as the supersonic Bell X-1. [14] In the early 1950s, there
was challenge to launch an artificial satellite for the International Geophysical Year (1957–1958).
An effort for this was the American Project Vanguard. After the Soviet space program's launch of
the world's first artificial satellite (Sputnik 1) on October 4, 1957, the attention of the United
States turned toward its own fledgling space efforts. The U.S. Congress, alarmed by the
perceived threat to national security and technological leadership (known as the "Sputnik crisis"),
urged immediate and swift action; President Dwight D. Eisenhower counseled more deliberate
measures. The result was a consensus that the White House forged among key interest groups,
including scientists committed to basic research; the Pentagon which had to match the Soviet
military achievement; corporate America looking for new business; and a strong new trend in
public opinion looking up to space exploration. [15]

On January 12, 1958, NACA organized a "Special Committee on Space Technology," headed
by Guyford Stever. [9] On January 14, 1958, NACA Director Hugh Dryden published "A National
Research Program for Space Technology," stating, [16]

It is of great urgency and importance to our country both from consideration of our prestige as a
nation as well as military necessity that this challenge [Sputnik] be met by an energetic program
of research and development for the conquest of space ... It is accordingly proposed that the
scientific research be the responsibility of a national civilian agency ... NACA is capable, by rapid
extension and expansion of its effort, of providing leadership in space technology. [16]

While this new federal agency would conduct all non-military space activity, the Advanced
Research Projects Agency (ARPA) was created in February 1958 to develop space technology
for military application. [17]

On July 29, 1958, Eisenhower signed the National Aeronautics and Space Act, establishing
NASA. When it began operations on October 1, 1958, NASA absorbed the 43-year-old NACA
intact; its 8,000 employees, an annual budget of US$100 million, three major research
laboratories (Langley Aeronautical Laboratory, Ames Aeronautical Laboratory, and Lewis Flight
Propulsion Laboratory) and two small test facilities. [18] Elements of the Army Ballistic Missile
Agency and the United States Naval Research Laboratory were incorporated into NASA. A

The Space Shuttle became the major focus of NASA in the late 1970s and the 1980s. Originally
planned as a frequently launchable, fully reusable vehicle, the design was changed to use
an expendable external propellant tank to reduce development cost, and four Space Shuttle
orbiters were built by 1985. The first to launch, Columbia, did so on April 12, 1981, the 20th
anniversary of the first human spaceflight. [60]

Its major components were a spaceplane orbiter with an external fuel tank and two solid-fuel
launch rockets at its side. The external tank, which was bigger than the spacecraft itself, was the
only major component that was not reused. The shuttle could orbit in altitudes of 185–643 km
(115–400 miles) [61] and carry a maximum payload (to low orbit) of 24,400 kg
(54,000 lb). [62] Missions could last from 5 to 17 days and crews could be from 2 to 8 astronauts. [61]

On 20 missions (1983–1998) the Space Shuttle carried Spacelab, designed in cooperation with
the European Space Agency (ESA). Spacelab was not designed for independent orbital flight,
but remained in the Shuttle's cargo bay as the astronauts entered and left it through
an airlock. [63] On June 18, 1983, Sally Ride became the first American woman in space, on board
the Space Shuttle Challenger STS-7 mission. [64] Another famous series of missions were
the launch and later successful repair of the Hubble Space Telescope in 1990 and 1993,
respectively. [65]In 1995, Russian-American interaction resumed with the Shuttle–Mir missions (1995–1998).
Once more an American vehicle docked with a Russian craft, this time a full-fledged space
station. This cooperation has continued with Russia and the United States as two of the biggest
partners in the largest space station built: the International Space Station (ISS). The strength of
their cooperation on this project was even more evident when NASA began relying on Russian
launch vehicles to service the ISS during the two-year grounding of the shuttle fleet following the
2003 Space Shuttle Columbia disaster.

The Shuttle fleet lost two orbiters and 14 astronauts in two disasters: Challenger in 1986,
and Columbia in 2003. [66] While the 1986 loss was mitigated by building the Space
Shuttle Endeavour from replacement parts, NASA did not build another orbiter to replace the
second loss. [66] NASA's Space Shuttle program had 135 missions when the program ended with
the successful landing of the Space Shuttle Atlantis at the Kennedy Space Center on July 21,
2011. The program spanned 30 years with over 300 astronauts sent into space. [67]

Apollo set major milestones in human spaceflight. It stands alone in sending crewed missions
beyond low Earth orbit, and landing humans on another celestial body. [54] Apollo 8 was the first
crewed spacecraft to orbit another celestial body, while Apollo 17 marked the last moonwalk and
the last crewed mission beyond low Earth orbit. The program spurred advances in many areas of
technology peripheral to rocketry and crewed spaceflight, including avionics,
telecommunications, and computers. Apollo sparked interest in many fields of engineering and
left many physical facilities and machines developed for the program as landmarks. Many objects
and artifacts from the program are on display at various locations throughout the world, notably
at the Smithsonian's Air and Space Museums.
